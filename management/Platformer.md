# CS1666 Platformer Management weeks

1. 9/15 - 9/21
	* Manager: Andrew Ashley
	* Goals:
		1. Get project description and goals approved
1. 9/29 - 10/5
	* Manager: Joshua Mateer
	* Goals:
		1. Create team credits sequence for the game
1. 10/6 - 10/19
	* Manager: Alvyn Berg
	* Goals:
		1. Main: Spawn player image and move it around 
                        the window to collide with stone platforms 
                        and a 'level-cleared' hit-box. 
		1. Networking team: Each person on Networking team 
			builds a web-server, following the final 
			project in the Rust Book
		1. Physics Team:  Implement basic gravity and basic 
                        movement (acceleration and jumping)
1. 10/20 - 10/26
	* Manager: Jake Sweeney
	* Goals:
		1. Main: Get the character animated (left and right movement animation, 
		         as well as jumping animation), and add a main menu
		3. Networking team: Create a basic server that receives player locations 
		         and broadcasts them to a client program
		5. Physics Team:  Implement rectangle colliders for player, floor tiles, 
		         and portal mechanics
1. 10/27 - 11/2
	* Manager: Kira Tsvetkova
	* Goals:
		1. Basic graphics done (all sprites and level assets)
		2. Basic rigidbody physics system done (rectangular colliders that have gravity/weight/friction)
		3. Basic portal creation/traversal (objects can teleport but do not conserve momentum)
		4. One basic "test" level to show off mechanics
		5. Progress towards online functionality
1. 11/3 - 11/9
	* Manager: Austin Brothers
	* Goals:
		1. Main: 
		 	- Create a bugs markdown file, to monitor bugs found with the game. Start fixing bugs as they are found. 
		 	- Implement a system to support multiple levels.
		2. Networking:
			- Have host and remote instances communicate across two separate systems.
			- Send and unpack bytes for animations an portals so remote instance reflects portal postitions and animations of host instance.
		3. Physics:
			- Add block and player's ability to carry block. Implement collision resolutions for block object.
			- Work on conserving momentum when hopping through a ground portal to a wall portal. If player has momentum in the y direction
			and enters a ground portal, that momentum should be conserved in the x direction, when exiting a wall portal.
1. 11/10 - 11/16
	* Manager: Evan Moran
	* Goals:
		1. General: 
		 	- Have Player Death Condition and Reset Player Position to level start
		 	- Add Ability to Cleanly End Credits Early
		 	- Continue to Identify and Fix Bugs
		2. Networking:
			- Finish Support for Separate System Play
			- Add Multithreading Support. Game will have separate threads for Game Simulation and Multiplayer Networking. Team may implement separate threads for Sending and Receiving or just have one thread total for handling the Networking.
		3. Physics:
			- Complete Pick-up-able Block implementation
			- Implement the ability for blocks to go through portals
1. 11/17 - 11/30
	* Manager: Greg Sack
	* Goals:
		1. General:
			- "Spawn" new block at beginning of each level (block currently maintains position on screen through level transitions)
		 	- Implement level restart button
		 	- Continue to Identify and Fix Bugs
		2. Networking:
			- Finish Support for Separate System Play
			- Limit multiplayer portal creation to one portal per player and allow both players to travel through eachothers' portal.
		3. Physics:
			- Implement block and obstacle collision (block falls through non-portal walls and platforms)
			- Implement pressure plate and player's ability to activate it 
1. 12/1 - 12/7
	* Manager: Bryce Anderson
	* Goals:
		1. General: 	
		 	- Continue to Identify and Fix Bugs
		2. Networking:
			- Have a playable multiplayer map
		3. Physics:
			- Implement ellipsoid collisions
			- Implement stretch goals (dash, throwable potions)
			- Implement proper collisions for the box
